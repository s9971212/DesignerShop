## <br/> <a name="introduction">‚ú® Introduction</a>

Back-end design for an online shopping platform using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JavaMail, Thymeleaf, and MySQL to deliver a secure, efficient, and scalable application.

Spring Boot provides the foundation for the application‚Äôs back-end, enabling rapid development and easy configuration of essential components. With Spring Boot, we can leverage a variety of preconfigured tools and libraries, such as Spring Security, to ensure secure authentication and authorization for customers and administrators, safeguarding sensitive user data and transactions.

JavaMail has been integrated with email features such as account verification, password reset and order confirmation. This increases user engagement and simplifies customer interaction with the platform.

For data storage, MySQL is used as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to handle product information, user profiles, order history and payment details. the high reliability and efficiency of MySQL ensures that large datasets can be managed and queried efficiently.

Together, these technologies provide a comprehensive and robust back-end architecture to build a secure and user-friendly online shopping experience.
